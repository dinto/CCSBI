            <br/>
            <br/>  
            <p><b>Citizen science is both an opportunity and a tool! An opportunity for the general public to take part and contribute to science. And a well versed tool for researchers to pool in crowd sourced data. Citizen science is the collaborative research carried out by citizen volunteers and professional scientists to solve a real world question. This crowd sourcing has the potential to collect numerous data from wider locations in a shorter period of time. 
            </b></p>
            <p><b>Across the world, Citizen science brings together people, scientists and policymakers for the conservation of natural resources. Starting from project design to policy implementation, the general public has potential roles to play.

            <h2><b></b>Citizen Science In India? </b></h2> 
            <p>We are facing a severe data shortage on biodiversity, especially on lesser-known and non-charismatic species. Crowd-sourced data could help us understand their ecology, distribution and population status. In a biodiversity-rich country like ours, Your contributions matter!</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Centre for Citizen Science and Biodiversity Informatics</b></h2>
    <p>
        Building a knowledgeable society is inevitable for the conservation and management of natural resources. Training the general public to explore and learn their biodiversity is the best way to do so and Citizen science can be a perfect tool for that. The Centre for Citizen Science and biodiversity informatics (CCSBI) is an initiative by the Kerala Forest Research Institute. We envision carving out a knowledgeable society of citizen scientists through outreach and capacity building, and to generate quality biodiversity data for the future management and conservation activities.
