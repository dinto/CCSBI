        Observation is the key to understanding biodiversity around us. Observing and recording biodiversity advances our understanding of how to protect its species. 
        It will be easier to manage and conserve the biodiversity around us if we upskill our abilities to understand nature events and identification of various species.

        Centre for Citizen Science and Biodiversity Informatics (CCSBI) organised a workshop on ‘Biodiversity assessment and introduction to ‘iNaturalist’ a citizen science platform’. 
        This workshop was arranged in collaboration with the Nature club, Sree Vivekananda College Kizhoor, Kunnamkulam. And aimed at students and faculties 
        who were interested in participating and organising biodiversity assessments in the campus. The workshop kicked off with a brief introduction to the ‘iNaturalist’ platform and 
        the mobile application. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify" style=" font-family: Merriweather;font-size: 22px;">
        The students who were equipped with the theory and the application on their smartphones were divided into groups. Each group was spearheaded by a CCSBI team member, who advised students on documenting the sightings to the application. 
        The submitted sightings were added to a project titled ‘Biodiversity of Sree Vivekananda College, Kunnamkulam’ in iNaturalist created by the centre. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify" style=" font-family: Merriweather;font-size: 22px;">
        Long-term updates to this project will be made through field surveys and online revisions on a regular basis.
